# coding-quiz

This quiz starts a coundown when the start button is clicked and also displays the 1st question. 
When a question is answered the next question is displayed.
When an incorrect answer is clicked it detucts 5 seconds from the timer.
I have not figured out how to get the time to stop counting down when the last question is answered. 
I have not figured out how to save the score.
I have not figured out how to log the initials of the test taker.

Perhaps I'll figure this out someday and resubmit this.
